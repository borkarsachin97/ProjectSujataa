# 🕊️ Project Sujataa  
### *Digitizing the Words of Babasaheb*  

---

## 📘 About  

**Project Sujataa** is a digital preservation and accessibility initiative dedicated to **Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar’s writings**, beginning with **Volume 40** of his collected works.  

The project aims to **convert non-Unicode Kruti Dev texts** into **universal, accessible formats** such as `.odt`, `.pdf`, `.epub`, `.xml`, and more — ensuring they can be **read, searched, and shared** across all platforms and devices.  

It also includes **audio versions** of each speech and article using **open-source TTS systems**, so that **visually impaired readers** and learners can access Babasaheb’s words in a voice that reaches the heart.

## 🎯 Objectives  

- Digitize all text from Kruti Dev → Unicode (Lohit Devanagari font).  
- Preserve structure, headings, and tables exactly as in originals.  
- Generate `.epub` and `.pdf` compatible with all modern readers.  
- Create **audio versions (WAV/MP3)** of every speech or article.  
- Release everything under an open and accessible license.

## 🪶 Meaning of “Sujataa”  

The name **Sujataa** comes from the compassionate woman who offered *kheer* to Gautama Buddha before his enlightenment.  
She symbolizes **kindness, nourishment, and awakening** — values that guide this project.  

Just as Sujataa nourished the body, **this project nourishes the mind**, reviving Babasaheb’s timeless wisdom for every generation.
